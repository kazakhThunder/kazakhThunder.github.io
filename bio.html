    <section class="text"><p>I have loved making images forever. I love the colors and shapes and emotions and ideas. I love being lucky enough to make a living doing what I love. I look at everything, the light reflecting from my childrens’ faces, a painting in a magazine or online. I love to read non-fiction and learn new things all the time. I am a bit of an introvert and workaholic and sometimes this can be misunderstood : I am shy. I care immensely about the work and every project is important. I never phone it in. I always bring my enthusiasm, passion and loads ideas to all projects. I work round the clock to ensure the job is done excellently. It is important for me to treat everyone- the whole team-with respect —though I am awful at names. I am very good at faces. I love faces, photographing faces, drawing faces. I live for my work, but I don’t take myself too seriously and I have a very dark sense of humor. </section></p>
